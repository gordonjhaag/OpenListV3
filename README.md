# OpenList Chrome Extension

OpenListV3 is forked from the original OpenList by Chris Dzombak. https://github.com/cdzombak/OpenList

The main changes are
 - update to Manifest V3
 - removal of right click context menu (may come back later, but I didn't use it and I don't have the need to maintain it)
 - addition of ability to open file:// URLs

OpenListV3 helps you manage lists of URLs. It's useful if you have a habit of emailing yourself lists of articles or pages to check out later.

With OpenList, you can:

* select a list of URLs (or search terms) in any web page or textarea, then open them all in new tabs
* paste a list of URLs (or search terms) into a popup, then open them all in new tabs
* get a list of all tabs in the current window

The name should probably be changed to something like TabsList, but that's a lot of effort.
